  "I’m Kanak Baghel, an aspiring data scientist and machine learning enthusiast with a strong foundation in business and analytics. After completing my BBA in Financial Investment Analysis, I pursued a Postgraduate Certification in Data Science and Business Analytics with Generative AI, offered by IBM and IIT Guwahati through Emeritus. My journey blends business insight with technical depth, enabling me to design end-to-end solutions that transform raw data into predictive intelligence. I specialize in Python, SQL, and visualization tools, and have hands-on experience applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems—from building models to architecting modular dashboards. Alongside my academic foundation, I thrive on Git/GitHub troubleshooting, reproducible workflows, and collaborative repo management, making data science accessible and impactful for teams and communities.
